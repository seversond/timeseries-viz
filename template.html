        <p class="lead text-muted">
          I was confronted with a relatively complex set of timeseries data
          and events.  They were intertwined.  I needed to do some diagnostics
          on the incoming data and the events.  It was all trading related.
          The prices and moving averages looked like continous variables and
          the trading events were buried in all the other activity.  The
          number of datapoints could be quite large at times.  This visualization
          was done with plotly.  If you hover over the upper right corner of the
          plot you will see the plotly menu appear.  Here you can access the
          zoom feature.  This affords users the ability to examine details
          milestone and timeseries data at a very low level.  The tool allowed
          the creation of a very custom plot in a relatively short period of time.
          Also the tips or tooltips when hovering over various objects offer
          considerable customization.  Also this plot was created and exported
          to an HTML.  This allowed for it to be embedded in a static webpage
          without the need of webserving infrastructure.  For some organizations
          this can provide both cost and security benefits.</p>
